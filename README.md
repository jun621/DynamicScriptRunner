# DynamicScriptRunner (WIP)
DynamicScriptRunner is a full-stack project with a user-friendly UI hosted on Amazon S3 and Amplify. The responsive UI, powered by TailwindCSS and React.js, ensures adaptability. It allows direct file uploads to Amazon S3, saving inputs and paths in DynamoDB via AWS Cognito's API gateway authorizer and Lambda function. The backend triggers script execution in an EC2 instance through DynamoDB events

# System Components 

## Frontend Component 

Frontend Component:
The responsive web UI, implemented using TailwindCSS and React.js, is hosted on Amazon S3 and Amplify. The sleek design and user-friendly interface provide users with an exceptional experience.

## Backend Component 

Facilitate direct file uploads from the browser to Amazon S3, ensuring efficient handling of data.

Utilize AWS Cognito to enable secure API gateway authorizer and Lambda function to save inputs and S3 paths into DynamoDB effectively.

Upon successful file upload to S3 and subsequent addition to DynamoDB, the backend automatically triggers a script run on an EC2 instance using DynamoDB events.

Sequence of Actions for VM Script Execution:

1.Retrieve input data from DynamoDB using an autogenerated nanoid.

2.Download the input file from S3 to the VM.

3.Append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file, saving it for processing.

4.Upload the output file to S3, ensuring it is stored efficiently.

5.Save the relevant outputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB for easy access and management.

6.Additionally, the system automatically terminates the VM upon successful execution, streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency. 

7.The frontend is hosted by Amazon S3 and Amplify, providing a seamless experience for users across various devices, thanks to the responsive UI implemented using TailwindCSS and React.js.
